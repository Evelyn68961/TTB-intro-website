# Time-to-Benefit (TTB) Educational Website

An interactive website introducing Time-to-Benefit analysis — a framework that answers the question: "How long do patients need to take a medication before it helps?"

## What is TTB?

Traditional clinical trials tell us whether a treatment works, but not how long patients must take it before experiencing benefit. TTB analysis fills this gap, helping clinicians and patients make informed decisions, especially for:

- Older adults with limited life expectancy
- Expensive or high-burden medications
- Shared decision-making conversations

## Features

- **What is TTB?** — Core concepts and clinical rationale
- **Methodology** — Step-by-step explanation of TTB calculation
- **Clinical Applications** — Published TTB estimates for statins, bisphosphonates, colchicine, SGLT2i, and intensive BP treatment
- **Interactive Demo** — Visualize survival curves and TTB thresholds

## Built with
